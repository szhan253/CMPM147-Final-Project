# The Chaos
This is a program that randomly generates a map based on the World Key. Players click on the chests to collect items. The items could be good stuff such as hearts, bad stuff like bombs, or just items collected for fun. The heart can help players to increase their health and the bomb is going to reduce players' health. When current health goes to zero, the web page is going to be reloaded automatically.
