# Garden
### Description
This is a program that uses the noise function which is provided by p5js to generate relatively random tiles to create a garden map. When the user inputs a different World Key, the map is going to use the input to generate different map tiles. If the tile is clicked, there is a different tile going to show up on the map.
### Artist Statement
I am trying to use code to generate a random garden map. It was hard to draw some extra graph on the background color of the tile to make it looks like it is a garden. Thus, I add some flowers to try to make it looks like what I am trying to create.
